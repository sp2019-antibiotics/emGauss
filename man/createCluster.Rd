\title{Create Cluster blal}
\usage{
createCluster(y, k, method = "quantile")
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a  (nx2) matrix (nx2) First column: number of bin, Second column: number of observation per bin}

\item{k}{a numeric value - number of components (fitted distributions)}

\item{method}{the method to be used for finding the k groups of data. For more information see Details}
}
\value{
kx2 matrix with mean and variance per component
}
\description{
The function estimates the mean and variance of the k groups of the underlying inputdata y.
}
\details{
For the input parameter method are two options available, namely binbased and quantiles.
binbased: the group calculation is based on bins. As a result of that each group has the same number of bins
quantiles: the group calculation is based on the observed values per bin. As a result of that each group has the same number of observations.

data  <- as.matrix(data)
createCluster(as.matrix(data), 2, method = 'binbased')
